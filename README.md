# SafariKeywordSearch

<http://safarikeywordsearch.aurlien.net>

Safari Keyword Search is a simple extension for Safari on macOs that enables keyword searching from the address bar. This is a simple but powerful feature that gives you access to several search engines using simple keywords. For example, you can search Wikipedia for information on monkeys by typing w monkeys in the address bar.

The following searches are included in the default set:

- **a**: amazon.com
- **d**: duckduckgo.com
- **down**: downforeveryoneorjustme.com
- **e**: ebay.com
- **g**: google.com
- **gm**: maps.google.com
- **imdb**: imdb.com
- **so**: stackoverflow.com
- **w**: en.wikipedia.org
- **wa**: wolframalpha.com
- **y**: youtube.com

You can also add your own searches in the app.

If you want to contribute a PR, feel free. Let me warn you, having zero prior experience with AppKit and macOS development, the source code is a lot like a garbage fire at a spaghetti factory.
